# AGENTS

## Scope
These guidelines apply to the entire repository.

## Documentation structure
- Keep `README.md` at the repository root as the entry point and table of contents for the project documentation.
- Place all other long-form documentation inside the `docs/` directory. Group related guidance under nested folders when it helps navigation (e.g., `docs/steering/`, `docs/planning/`).
- When introducing new documents, add a short summary and link in the README table of contents.

## Writing style
- Prefer organized headings and ordered/unordered lists for clarity.
- When synthesizing or revising existing material, preserve original intent while clarifying structure and language.
- Use British English spelling where a regional choice is needed, unless a direct quote requires otherwise.

## Maintenance
- Remove unused assets and keep only Markdown files unless a task explicitly requires other formats.
- No automated tests are currently required for documentation-only changes.
