# Mind Fragment Design Reset

This repository now serves as the documentation hub for the Mind Fragment project reboot. All non-Markdown assets from the earlier Phaser prototype have been retired so we can focus on steering the concept and planning the block-based programming systems.

## How to Navigate
- **Project conventions:** See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for documentation structure and writing guidance.
- **Steering notes:**
  - [Core Experience Steering Notes](docs/steering/core-loop.md) — opening sequence, layered loops, and key systems.
  - [Dialogue Tone & Sample Barks](docs/steering/dialogue-tone.md) — voice direction with ready-to-use lines.
- **Planning:**
  - [Block Programming Plan](docs/planning/block-programming.md) — goals, architecture, and roadmap for the visual programming pillar.
- **Reference:**
  - [BlockKit Starter Capabilities](docs/reference/blockkit-starter.md) — summary of the previous editor technology and how it informs the reboot.

## Current Focus
1. Finalise the block schema and runtime expectations described in the planning document.
2. Draft mock-ups of the editor HUD and debugging tools inspired by the steering notes.
3. Continue capturing tone and narrative beats while systems are in flux.

Each document is intended to evolve as we iterate. Update the README when new guides are added so it remains the single source of truth for the project’s documentation map.
