# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the advanced drag-and-drop functionality that is currently missing or incomplete in the simplified-stack-blocks library. While basic drag-and-drop from palette to main editor works correctly, several advanced scenarios need to be implemented and tested to provide a complete visual programming experience.

The current failing tests indicate gaps in:
- Complex drag-drop scenarios (C-block slots, inter-sequence moves)
- Advanced block movement operations  
- Multi-step drag operations

This enhancement will make the visual programming interface more intuitive and complete, allowing users to freely rearrange blocks in all supported contexts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: C-Block Slot Drag and Drop

**User Story:** As a visual programmer, I want to drag blocks from the palette directly into C-block slots (like repeat loops), so that I can quickly build nested program structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I drag a palette block over a C-block slot THEN the slot SHALL highlight to indicate it's a valid drop target
2. WHEN I drop a palette block into an empty C-block slot THEN the system SHALL create a new block instance and place it in that slot
3. WHEN I drop a palette block into a C-block slot that already contains blocks THEN the system SHALL insert the new block at the appropriate position based on drop location
4. IF the C-block has multiple slots (like if-else) THEN the system SHALL correctly identify which slot is being targeted
5. WHEN I drag over nested C-blocks THEN the system SHALL highlight only the innermost valid drop target

### Requirement 2: Block Movement Between Sequences

**User Story:** As a visual programmer, I want to move existing blocks between different sequences (main program, C-block slots), so that I can reorganize my program structure as it evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I drag an existing block from the main sequence to a C-block slot THEN the block SHALL be removed from the main sequence and added to the target slot
2. WHEN I drag an existing block from one C-block slot to another THEN the block SHALL be moved between the slots correctly
3. WHEN I drag an existing block from a C-block slot to the main sequence THEN the block SHALL be extracted from the slot and added to the main sequence
4. WHEN I drag a block within the same sequence THEN the block SHALL be reordered to the new position
5. IF I drag a C-block that contains other blocks THEN all nested blocks SHALL move together as a unit
6. WHEN a block is moved THEN the source location SHALL be updated to remove the block and the target location SHALL be updated to include it

### Requirement 3: Advanced Drop Target Detection

**User Story:** As a visual programmer, I want clear visual feedback about where blocks can be dropped, so that I understand the available placement options while dragging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start dragging a block THEN all valid drop targets SHALL be visually highlighted
2. WHEN I drag over a valid drop target THEN it SHALL show enhanced highlighting to indicate active target
3. WHEN I drag over an invalid drop target THEN it SHALL show no highlighting or indicate it's invalid
4. WHEN dragging over a sequence with existing blocks THEN insertion indicators SHALL show where the block would be placed
5. IF I'm dragging near the boundary between blocks THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate whether the drop would insert before or after existing blocks

### Requirement 4: Multi-Step Drag Operations

**User Story:** As a visual programmer, I want to perform multiple drag operations in sequence without losing context, so that I can efficiently build complex program structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I complete one drag operation THEN the system SHALL be immediately ready for the next drag operation
2. WHEN I perform rapid successive drags THEN each operation SHALL be processed correctly without interference
3. WHEN I drag multiple blocks in quick succession THEN the program state SHALL remain consistent
4. IF I start a drag operation but cancel it (drag without dropping) THEN the system SHALL return to the previous state
5. WHEN performing multiple operations THEN the undo/redo state SHALL be maintained correctly

### Requirement 5: Complex Block Type Handling

**User Story:** As a visual programmer, I want all block types (hat, statement, C-block, reporter) to be moveable to appropriate locations, so that I have full flexibility in program organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I drag a hat block THEN it SHALL be moveable to any position in the main sequence
2. WHEN I drag a statement block THEN it SHALL be moveable to main sequence or C-block slots
3. WHEN I drag a C-block THEN it SHALL be moveable to main sequence or other C-block slots (nesting)
4. WHEN I drag a reporter block THEN it SHALL be moveable like other blocks (no artificial restrictions)
5. IF I try to place a block in an incompatible location THEN the system SHALL prevent the drop and provide feedback

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Edge Cases

**User Story:** As a visual programmer, I want the drag-and-drop system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that I don't lose work or encounter crashes during complex operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I drag a block to an invalid location THEN the system SHALL return the block to its original position
2. WHEN I drag a block that contains references to other blocks THEN all references SHALL be updated correctly
3. IF a drag operation fails due to an error THEN the system SHALL restore the previous program state
4. WHEN I drag blocks rapidly THEN the system SHALL handle all operations without data corruption
5. IF I drag a block while another operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL queue or reject the operation appropriately

### Requirement 7: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a visual programmer, I want drag-and-drop operations to be smooth and responsive, so that the interface feels natural and doesn't impede my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start dragging a block THEN the visual feedback SHALL appear within 16ms (60fps)
2. WHEN I move the cursor while dragging THEN the drag preview SHALL follow smoothly without lag
3. WHEN I drop a block THEN the operation SHALL complete within 100ms
4. IF the program contains many blocks THEN drag operations SHALL maintain consistent performance
5. WHEN multiple users are working (future consideration) THEN drag operations SHALL not conflict
