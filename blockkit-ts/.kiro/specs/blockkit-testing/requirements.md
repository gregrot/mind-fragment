# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive testing for the BlockKit TS library, which provides both graph-based and scratch-style visual block programming editors. The testing suite will ensure reliability, correctness, and maintainability of the core library components, including the block registry, graph management, interpreters, default blocks, and both editor implementations. The tests will cover unit testing, integration testing, and example validation to provide confidence in the library's functionality for developers who embed it in their applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a library developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for core components, so that I can ensure individual modules work correctly in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the BlockRegistry is tested THEN the system SHALL validate block registration, retrieval, and type compatibility checking
2. WHEN the Graph state management is tested THEN the system SHALL verify node and link operations including add, remove, update, and serialization
3. WHEN the Interpreter is tested THEN the system SHALL validate topological sorting, execution order, and input resolution
4. WHEN DefaultBlocks are tested THEN the system SHALL verify each block's evaluation logic and type handling
5. WHEN the StackRegistry is tested THEN the system SHALL validate stack block registration and retrieval
6. WHEN the StackInterpreter is tested THEN the system SHALL verify execution of different block forms and slot handling

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a library developer, I want integration tests for complete workflows, so that I can ensure components work together correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a complete graph workflow is tested THEN the system SHALL validate creating nodes, connecting them, and executing the graph
2. WHEN a complete stack workflow is tested THEN the system SHALL validate building programs with different block types and executing them
3. WHEN serialization/deserialization is tested THEN the system SHALL ensure graphs and programs can be saved and restored correctly
4. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN the system SHALL validate proper error handling for invalid graphs, missing blocks, and execution failures
5. WHEN type validation is tested THEN the system SHALL verify schema validation for both graph and stack data structures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a library developer, I want tests for the React components, so that I can ensure the UI editors render and behave correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the BlockEditor component is tested THEN the system SHALL verify it renders with a registry and handles basic interactions
2. WHEN the StackEditor component is tested THEN the system SHALL verify it renders with a registry and program state
3. WHEN component props are tested THEN the system SHALL validate proper handling of registry, height, program, and onChange props
4. WHEN component state changes are tested THEN the system SHALL verify proper updates and callbacks
5. WHEN component error boundaries are tested THEN the system SHALL ensure graceful handling of invalid props or state
6. WHEN drag-and-drop operations are tested THEN the system SHALL verify that stack-based implementation allows moves that graph-based implementation restricts
7. WHEN block reordering is tested THEN the system SHALL validate that moving blocks between valid positions works correctly in stack editor

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a library developer, I want tests for the example applications, so that I can ensure the demos work correctly and serve as reliable documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main App example is tested THEN the system SHALL verify both editor modes render and switch correctly
2. WHEN the StackApp example is tested THEN the system SHALL verify program building, execution, and export functionality
3. WHEN example interactions are tested THEN the system SHALL validate toolbar buttons, mode switching, and program operations
4. WHEN example error handling is tested THEN the system SHALL ensure proper feedback for invalid operations
5. WHEN example data flow is tested THEN the system SHALL verify programs execute correctly and produce expected outputs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a library developer, I want performance and edge case tests, so that I can ensure the library handles complex scenarios gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN large graphs are tested THEN the system SHALL validate performance with many nodes and connections
2. WHEN complex nested structures are tested THEN the system SHALL verify handling of deeply nested C-blocks and reporter chains
3. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN the system SHALL validate handling of empty graphs, circular dependencies, and malformed data
4. WHEN memory usage is tested THEN the system SHALL ensure proper cleanup and no memory leaks
5. WHEN concurrent operations are tested THEN the system SHALL verify thread safety and state consistency

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a library developer, I want comprehensive drag-and-drop behavior tests, so that I can ensure the stack-based implementation correctly enforces movement restrictions and handles valid drag-and-drop operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing block movement within the same control structure THEN the system SHALL verify that moving a block between valid positions in a stack works correctly
2. WHEN testing the specific scenario of moving the first "say hello" block after "wait 1 second" THEN the system SHALL validate this operation is properly restricted with "Cannot move block after itself or its descendants"
3. WHEN testing movement restrictions THEN the system SHALL verify that operations blocked by descendant relationships are consistently prevented in stack implementation
4. WHEN testing complex nested structures THEN the system SHALL validate drag-and-drop operations within and between different control blocks
5. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL verify proper handling of invalid drop targets and boundary conditions
6. WHEN testing program integrity THEN the system SHALL ensure drag-and-drop operations maintain program correctness and execution order

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a library developer, I want automated test infrastructure, so that I can run tests efficiently and integrate with CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test configuration is set up THEN the system SHALL provide Jest or Vitest configuration with TypeScript support
2. WHEN test scripts are configured THEN the system SHALL provide npm scripts for running tests, coverage, and watch mode
3. WHEN test utilities are created THEN the system SHALL provide helper functions for creating test data and mocking components
4. WHEN coverage reporting is configured THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive coverage reports for all modules
5. WHEN test execution is configured THEN the system SHALL ensure tests can run reliably in development environments
