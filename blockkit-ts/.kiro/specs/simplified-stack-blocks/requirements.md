# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a simplified visual programming library focused exclusively on Scratch-style stack blocks. Starting from a clean slate, we will build a minimal, production-ready library that provides drag-and-drop visual programming with stack blocks only.

The implementation will use a clean list-based stack structure that eliminates movement restrictions and provides an intuitive user experience, without any legacy complexity or backwards compatibility concerns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer integrating visual programming, I want a simple stack-based block editor, so that I can provide users with an intuitive drag-and-drop programming interface without complex graph concepts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer imports the library THEN the system SHALL provide a single StackEditor component
2. WHEN a developer creates a StackEditor THEN the system SHALL render a visual programming interface with drag-and-drop capabilities
3. WHEN a developer provides block definitions THEN the system SHALL display them in a palette for users to drag into the editor
4. IF no blocks are provided THEN the system SHALL include basic default blocks (event, control, looks)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an end user of the visual programming interface, I want to drag blocks from a palette and arrange them in sequences, so that I can create programs visually without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags a block from the palette THEN the system SHALL create a new block instance in the editor
2. WHEN a user drops a block in the editor THEN the system SHALL position it in the appropriate sequence
3. WHEN a user drags an existing block THEN the system SHALL allow moving it to any valid position without artificial restrictions
4. WHEN blocks are arranged in sequences THEN the system SHALL visually represent the execution order

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to create nested control structures with C-shaped blocks, so that I can build complex programs with loops and conditionals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags a C-shaped block (like repeat) THEN the system SHALL create a slot where other blocks can be nested
2. WHEN a user drops blocks into a C-block slot THEN the system SHALL create a nested sequence
3. WHEN a user moves blocks between different sequences THEN the system SHALL update the program structure accordingly
4. WHEN nested structures are created THEN the system SHALL maintain proper visual indentation and connection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute the visual programs created by users, so that the block arrangements can produce actual runtime behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a program is executed THEN the system SHALL run blocks in the correct sequence order
2. WHEN C-blocks are encountered THEN the system SHALL execute their nested sequences appropriately
3. WHEN reporter blocks are used as inputs THEN the system SHALL evaluate them and provide values to parent blocks
4. IF execution errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide meaningful feedback

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define custom block types with specific behaviors, so that I can create domain-specific visual programming languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer defines a block specification THEN the system SHALL validate the block structure and behavior
2. WHEN custom blocks are registered THEN the system SHALL make them available in the palette
3. WHEN custom blocks are executed THEN the system SHALL call the provided execution functions
4. WHEN blocks have inputs THEN the system SHALL provide proper input handling and validation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to serialize and deserialize visual programs, so that users can save and load their work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a program is serialized THEN the system SHALL produce a JSON representation of the complete program state
2. WHEN a JSON program is loaded THEN the system SHALL reconstruct the visual program accurately
3. WHEN serialization occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve all program structure, block configurations, and relationships
4. WHEN the program format is designed THEN the system SHALL use a clean, simple structure without legacy considerations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive TypeScript support, so that I can build type-safe applications with proper IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the library is imported THEN the system SHALL provide complete TypeScript type definitions
2. WHEN block specifications are defined THEN the system SHALL enforce type safety for configurations and inputs
3. WHEN the API is used THEN the system SHALL provide proper IntelliSense and compile-time error checking
4. WHEN custom types are defined THEN the system SHALL integrate them properly with the type system

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a minimal and focused implementation, so that the library is easy to understand and maintain with the fewest possible files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the system SHALL consist of minimal essential files only
2. WHEN integrating the library THEN the system SHALL require minimal configuration to get started
3. WHEN testing is implemented THEN the system SHALL focus only on core execution and drag-drop functionality
4. WHEN the project is built THEN the system SHALL avoid complex build processes, CI configurations, and unnecessary tooling
