# Mind Fragment Roadmap

## Delivery Principles
- Anchor every milestone around playable feedback. Each phase should end with something the team can run, poke, and critique.
- Preserve the block-programming-first workflow; new systems must report back into the block workspace or entity overlay to remain discoverable.
- Document intent as soon as it lands. Update this roadmap and the steering guide whenever priorities shift so downstream contributors stay aligned.

## Phase 1 â€” Simulation & Programming Cohesion
**Objective**: consolidate the existing Pixi simulation, mechanism overlay, and block workspace into a reliable authoring loop.

- âœ… Stabilise the Pixi shell initialisation and teardown lifecycle (covered by `SimulationShell`).
- âœ… Maintain per-mechanism workspace state in React so switching entities retains draft programmes.
- ðŸš§ Surface runtime compile errors inline in the overlay using `ProgramRunnerStatus`.
- ðŸš§ Persist overlay edits optimistically and implement retry flows via `EntityOverlayManager` events.
- ðŸ“Œ Audit drag-and-drop affordances for accessibility (keyboard focus, ARIA labelling, and touch targets).
- âœ… Capture the tree-harvesting recipe (`Forever â†’ Scan Area â†’ Move To â†’ Use Tool Slot â†’ Gather Resource â†’ Deposit Cargo / Wait`) so designers can script the new automation path.

## Phase 2 â€” Telemetry & Debugging
**Objective**: make the consequences of a programme obvious by expanding telemetry capture and visualisation.

- ðŸš§ Extend `simulationRuntime.subscribeTelemetry` consumers with grouped channels (Power, Navigation, Threats).
- ðŸ“Œ Add timeline scrubbing for recent telemetry snapshots to aid debugging.
- ðŸ“Œ Introduce breakpoint blocks or conditional pauses to let designers inspect world state mid-run.
- ðŸ“Œ Publish a diagnostics overlay that cross-references inventory, chassis capacity, and queued actions for the selected mechanism.

## Phase 3 â€” World Growth & Narrative Hooks
**Objective**: add context so the crash-site feels alive while keeping focus on programmable systems.

- ðŸ“Œ Re-enable onboarding through the `ONBOARDING_ENABLED` gate with a streamlined three-step tutorial.
- ðŸ“Œ Populate the scene with interactive points (e.g. resource nodes, hazards) driven by ECS components so block programmes have meaningful targets.
- ðŸ“Œ Layer narrative prompts triggered by telemetry eventsâ€”short, flavourful callouts that respect the tone described in the steering guide.
- ðŸ“Œ Prototype cooperative tasks requiring multiple mechanisms to share inventory or chained programmes.

## Phase 4 â€” Persistence & Sharing
**Objective**: support longer sessions and collaboration without breaking the tight iteration loop.

- ðŸ“Œ Persist mechanism configurations (chassis slots, inventory assignments, block programmes) to a storage backend.
- ðŸ“Œ Implement save slots or timeline branches so players can experiment and roll back.
- ðŸ“Œ Add export/import for programmes in a human-readable JSON format compatible with `WorkspaceState`.
- ðŸ“Œ Explore cloud-sharing hooks so designers can distribute canonical challenge setups.

## Maintenance Backlog
These items remain important but should be scheduled once the above phases are underway:

- Improve automated coverage for drag-and-drop logic (`useBlockWorkspace` and drop utilities).
- Profile Pixi rendering under heavy entity counts; tune asset streaming via `assetService` to prevent stalls.
- Replace placeholder art with a production-ready asset pipeline once the simulation loop stabilises.
- Review dependency updates quarterly to keep Vite, React, and Pixi security patches current.

Update progress markers (`âœ…`, `ðŸš§`, `ðŸ“Œ`) as work advances. Treat this roadmap as a living document; prune or extend phases when playtest feedback reveals new priorities.
