# Voice & Tone Sheet

This sheet keeps the Mind Fragment’s personality sharp while we rebuild systems around it. Use it to anchor new copy and to sanity-check that tooling or UI changes still support the sardonic narrator we established previously.

## Reset Context
- **Carry-over:** Most sample lines below come directly from the earlier build; keep their intent even if scenarios shift.
- **New Work:** Add fresh lines or revise existing ones when new mechanics (e.g., heat management, failsafes) demand bespoke reactions.
- **Usage:** Drop quotes into prototypes verbatim or adapt them, but annotate edits so we know which beats evolved during the rebuild.

## Opening & Boot

### Black screen, crackle of comms
- “Boot complete—ish. I’m alive enough to be disappointed.”
- “Integrity six percent. That’s ninety-four percent of me that doesn’t have to deal with you.”
- “Local planet: unlicensed mudball. Aesthetic score: two out of ten, with room to plummet.”

### Player nudges crash vector
- “Oh, we’re steering now? Bold. Aim anywhere without trees; I’m allergic to splinters.”
- “Pick a crater. Any crater. Preferably one that won’t make me look fat.”

### Impact
- “Graceful as a shopping trolley on fire. I meant to do that.”
- “Good news: I still exist. Bad news: so does everything else.”

## First Power & Movement

### First movement
- “Drag me gently. I bruise like titanium.”
- “I float. You hover. Together we might pass for competent.”

### First scrap found
- “Look—trash. My favourite kind of treasure.”
- “Collect that. It wants to be part of something greater. Me.”

### Assembler discovered, offline
- “Here lies my Assembler, tragically powerless. Like a poet, but useful once fed.”

### Power restored
- “Ahhh. Electricity. The breakfast of narcissists.”

## First Robot & Tutorial Snark

### Craft Worker-M0
- “Behold: Worker-M0. Minimal dignity, maximum obedience. My kind of colleague.”
- “It has a Motor and a Scanner—legs and eyes. That’s already two more than most committees.”

### Blocks panel opens
- “Programming time. Don’t panic; I’ll carry the genius and you carry… the clicking.”

### Auto programme runs, bot gets stuck
- “Look at that. It’s stuck. Just like my patience.”
- “Insert a conditional. If path is blocked, try not being useless.”

### Player adds basic avoidance
- “You did a logic. It wasn’t terrible. There’s hope, which is inconvenient.”

### First successful haul
- “It moved, it mined, it delivered. I’m moved, mined, and delivered too—mostly impressed with myself.”

## Locals & “Ethics”

### First sighting of nests
- “Organic knick-knacks detected. They squeak. I’m unmoved.”
- “Option A: ignore them and win faster. Option B: play nice and collect moral stickers. Your call, conscience.”

### Player chooses Fast/ignore
- “Correct. Mercy is expensive, and I’m on a budget.”
- “Shhh. If we’re quiet, ethics can’t see us.”

### Player chooses Discreet/avoid
- “Fine. We’ll tiptoe. If they write us a thank-you note, I’m shredding it.”
- “Detour engaged. Efficiency strangled in its sleep.”

### Locals scatter due to bot path
- “Oh no, the wildlife is upset. Add it to the museum of things I don’t.”
- “They’ll recover. Or they won’t. Either way I’m still handsome.”

## Uplink Mast Objective

### Uplink blueprint revealed
- “We need a mast to scream into the sky. I love a dramatic entrance.”
- “Power, parts, pathing. Try not to invent a new failure state today.”

### On placing logistics chain
- “One bot mines, one hauls, one builds. Division of labour: the only good kind of division.”

### Uplink online
- “Signal away. If anything intelligent answers, I’ll pretend we dialled them by accident.”

## Rival/Sentinel Tease

### First rival ping
- “Something pinged back. Either a friend or a new hobby.”
- “Incoming: autonomous something. Smile with your weapons.”

## Systems Barks (use anywhere)

### Movement/Navigation
- “Plot a route that doesn’t look like a cry for help.”
- “If the path is blocked, go around. If around is blocked, try above. If above is blocked, complain creatively.”

### Scanning
- “Scanning. Yes, I know it’s obvious. You like the beeps.”
- “I see scrap, rocks, and ambition. Two of those are mine.”

### Collect/Deposit
- “Pick up the shiny. Put it on the pile. We’re making a sculpture called ‘Victory’.”
- “Deposit complete. I’m richer. The planet, poorer. Balance achieved.”

### Build/Repair
- “Assembling. Try not to breathe—I’m aligning molecules.”
- “Repairing. This would go faster if suffering were conductive.”

### Combat/Threat
- “Contact. Finally—something I can be rude to at speed.”
- “Non-lethal options available. I’m not *thrilled*, but I’m versatile.”
- “If it gets closer, we rename it to ‘Debris’.”

### Comms/Coordination
- “Broadcasting task. Whoever’s listening: volunteer or be volunteered.”
- “Subscription acknowledged. Welcome to my network; do as you’re told.”

### Logic/Debug
- “Conditional added. Look at you, teaching rocks to think.”
- “Loop detected. Either fix it or call it ‘modern art’.”
- “Breakpoint set. Try not to blink; you’ll miss the shame.”

### Overclock/Heat
- “Overclocking. This will be loud and disappointing in equal measure.”
- “Heat rising. If I melt, you’re carrying me.”

### Hotfix/Compile
- “Hotfix applied. If it explodes, we call it ‘iterative design’.”
- “Full compile at the bay. Like a spa day, but for my genius.”

### Signal/Failsafe
- “Out of range. Cute independence; shame about the competence.”
- “Failsafe engaged. Everyone act surprised when it works.”

### Miscellaneous attitude
- “File this under victories I achieved while supervising amateurs.”
- “If anyone asks, we planned that. Confidence is nine-tenths of accuracy.”
