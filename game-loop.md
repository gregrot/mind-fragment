awesome — here’s a tight, playable opening and a fun loop you can build on, tuned to your Culture-ish premise (you’re a battleship Mind fragment, top-down 2D, robots are modular, and Scratch-style blocks unlock via modules).

# Opening: “Crash, Boot, Consequence”

**Cold open (10–20 seconds, interactive):**

* Planetary night. Your descent track is a smoking line across the map. You can *drag* a tiny reticle to steer the final seconds of the crash, nudging where the wreck ends up (this seeds your starting biome/resources).
* Impact. HUD blooms: **CORE INTEGRITY: 6%**, **CONNECTIONS: severed**, **LOCAL SAPIENCE: unknown**.

**First boot (you-as-UI voiceover + on-map prompts):**

* “Hello me. I am… pieces.” The wreck is now your **Mind Fragment** (MF). The only direct input is a slow hover and a short-range **Ping**.
* **Goal 1: Power** — Ping reveals scattered **Capacitor Shards** and **Ferrous Debris**. You drag the MF to collect the first few bits manually (teaches movement + pickup radius).
* You discover a half-buried **Assembler Bay**—no power. Return shards to the wreck to light it. **Power Online → Assembler Booted**.

**First robot (guided build + first program):**

* Craft a **Chassis: Worker-M0** (1 slot each: Motor, Scanner). Modules determine the starting block palette.
* On craft, the **Blocks Panel** unfurls with a tiny tutorial “program”:

  * `Start → Scan(Nearest: Scrap) → MoveTo(Target) → Collect() → Return(Home) → Deposit()`
* You don’t place code yet; the game places it for you, *then immediately breaks it*: the robot gets stuck behind a rock.
* You are taught the first edit: insert a conditional and a simple fail-safe loop:

  * `If PathBlocked() → TryStep(Around) (repeat 3) → Else Continue`
* Hit **Run**. Robot completes its first haul. **Juice moment:** a little fanfare, your power meter ticks up, new **Fabrication Recipe: Manipulator Arm** unlocks.

**The ethical hook (SC vibes, soft):**

* Your ping reveals **Curious Locals** (simple non-sapient for now) nesting near rich deposits. The robot’s default route stresses them (they scatter, knocking over nests and lowering your “Diplomacy/Discretion” meter).
* You’re offered two curated alternative programs:

  1. **Fast** (ignores locals, higher yield, raises detection/hostility).
  2. **Discreet** (pathfinds around nests, lower yield, improves standing, unlocks social signal data later).
* Whichever you choose sets a light-touch playstyle flag (not permanent) and makes your decisions feel like SC-style “means vs ends” from minute one.

**Act 0 exit condition (30–45 min):**

* Rebuild **Uplink Mast**. To power it you must place 2–3 robots with different modules and programs (harvest → refine → deliver).
* First **Contact Signal** goes out… and something answers (a territorial autonomous sentinel or rival salvager). That sets the first antagonist loop.

# The Core Game Loop (layered)

## Micro loop (seconds → minutes): “Write → Test → Watch”

1. **Plan:** Drop/edit a block program for a robot (path, harvest, defend, haul, repair).
2. **Run:** Watch in-world execution; the MF can ping, tug, or apply **Overclock** (short boost, heat cost).
3. **Tweak:** You notice edge cases (stuck, hostile, weather). Insert conditionals, change priorities, or swap modules.
4. **Reward:** Resources delivered, power spikes, little “insight shards” unlock new blocks or block modifiers.

Why it’s fun: frequent “aha” moments; your code literally moves the world around.

## Meso loop (10–30 minutes): “Build the Chain”

1. **Scout** new nodes (ore, flora, data relics) with lightweight drones.
2. **Craft Modules** to unlock block families (Motor → motion primitives; Scanner → detection/filters; Manipulator → interactors; Comms → coordination; Weapon/Shield → combat blocks; Logic Core → memory, loops, timers).
3. **Design Pipelines:** Worker A mines, Mule B hauls, Builder C constructs, Sentry D patrols. Programs publish/subscribe via topics (“Depot-A/Need-Haul”).
4. **Stabilize:** Place **Debug Beacons** (area shows execution traces + timing) to fix bottlenecks/hangs.
5. **Incidents:** Weather surge, wildlife migration, rival patrol → you patch code or swap modules under pressure.

## Macro loop (hours): “Awaken the Mind”

1. **Gather Core Shards** to expand MF capacity (more concurrent robots, wider signal, faster compile).
2. **Territory & Reputation:** Outposts act as compilers/depots. Your “Discretion / Impact” axis gates story beats and faction reactions.
3. **Tech Web:** Not linear; each node unlocks a **block modifier** (e.g., `MoveTo` gains `AvoidBiome(type)`; `Scan` gains `TagWrite(key,value)`).
4. **Story Arcs:**

   * **The Sentinel** (defensive AI probing your footprint).
   * **The Nomads** (strange locals you can stress, ignore, or protect).
   * **The Rival Salvager** (industrial, aggressive; steals nodes unless counter-programmed).
5. **Milestones:** Reconstitute enough cognition to choose: extract and leave, stay and uplift/protect, or quietly dismantle threats.

# Early Progression (first 2–3 hours)

**Modules → Blocks you unlock (examples):**

* **Motor Mk1:** `MoveTo`, `TryStep`, `Orbit(target,radius)`, `Follow(entity)`
* **Scanner Mk1:** `Scan(filter)`, `LineOfSight`, `TagRead`, `Detect(Hazard|Nest|Enemy)`
* **Manipulator Mk1:** `Collect`, `Deposit`, `Build(blueprint)`, `Repair(target)`
* **Comms Mk1:** `Broadcast(topic,payload)`, `Subscribe(topic)`, `Request(“Haul”, payload)`
* **Logic Core Mk1:** `If`, `Repeat(n)`, `Wait(t)`, `Remember(key,val)`, `Recall(key)`
* **Shield/Weapon Mk1:** `ThreatResponse(mode)`, `Stun`, `Guard(radius)`

**Key constraints that create interesting decisions:**

* **Program RAM per chassis** (forces concise logic or module upgrades).
* **Energy & Heat** (Overclocking risks shutdowns).
* **Signal Fog** (bots out of range fall back to a `Failsafe` routine you define—great teaching moment).
* **Noise** (your ops footprint affects detection and ecology).

# Starter Quests (tight & teachy)

1. **“Spark the Bay”** — Gather 20 scrap, 5 shards; build Worker-M0; run first haul program.
2. **“Paths of Least Harm”** — Reprogram route to avoid nests (teach conditionals + scan filters).
3. **“Chain Reaction”** — Build a second bot to auto-haul to the Assembler while the first keeps mining (teach pub/sub topics).
4. **“Soft Walls”** — A weather front shifts terrain friction; insert a `Wait(weather<storm)` or `Reroute` block.
5. **“First Intrusion”** — A sentinel drone tests your perimeter; craft a **Sentry-M1** with `Guard` + `Stun`, but avoid lethal (keeps Discretion high).

# Systems That Make the Loop Sing

* **Programming-as-Loot:** ruins drop **Block Modifiers** (e.g., `MoveTo` gains `Cost=Terrain`, enabling cheap pathfinding heuristics).
* **Field Breakpoints:** place a **Debug Beacon**; within its radius you can step programs, watch variable bubbles, and hot-patch for 20 seconds.
* **Compile Bay vs. Hotfix:** full compile at bays (safe), or **Hotfix** inline (faster, adds heat + temporary instability).
* **Templates & Tricks:** save programs as cards (e.g., “Gentle Harvester”, “Relay Scout”), then slot them into new robots and tweak.
* **Ethical Pressure:** optional contracts from locals/rival (“clear the nests” vs “relocate them”). Mechanics are identical, *framing* is different; rewards reflect stance.
* **Bossy Puzzles:** the Rival Salvager is essentially a scripted bot swarm with visible logic tells—you beat them by reading and counter-programming their routines.

# A Short Sample Script (opening beats, in-voice)

* **MF:** “Boot… fractionally successful. I am… me-ish.”
* **System:** *Power low. Assembler offline. Locals: unclassified.*
* **MF (tooltips):** “Drag me. Yes, I’m the pretty crater.”
* **On first scrap delivered:** “Assembler hum achieved. That sound? Progress.”
* **On first program run:** “Look at them go. I made a friend. It obeys!”
* **On nest disturbance:** “Ah. Consequences. Let’s be better than my first idea.”
* **On Uplink Mast online:** “Signal whispering across a dark sky. I hope only the right ears are listening.”

---

# Win/Fail & Run Rhythm

* **Fail forward:** If MF integrity hits 0, you don’t “die”; you drop to **Safe Mode** and must dispatch a **Repairer** with a micro-program using the limited **Failsafe Palette** you defined earlier.
* **Session arcs:** 20–40 minute “objective slices” (power a bay, secure a node, uplift a hamlet, repel a incursion). Every slice ends with a clean save + a new block/modifier tease.
