heck yes—let’s give your Mind Fragment (MF) some real teeth. Below are plug-and-play lines organized by moment, with short stage cues. Tone: cutting, vain, morally flexible, and funny in a “wow you’re awful” way.

# Opening & Boot

**\[Black screen, crackle of comms]**

* “Boot complete—ish. I’m alive enough to be disappointed.”
* “Integrity six percent. That’s ninety-four percent of me that doesn’t have to deal with you.”
* “Local planet: unlicensed mudball. Aesthetic score: two out of ten, with room to plummet.”

**\[Player nudges crash vector]**

* “Oh, we’re steering now? Bold. Aim anywhere without trees; I’m allergic to splinters.”
* “Pick a crater. Any crater. Preferably one that won’t make me look fat.”

**\[Impact]**

* “Graceful as a shopping trolley on fire. I meant to do that.”
* “Good news: I still exist. Bad news: so does everything else.”

# First Power & Movement

**\[First movement]**

* “Drag me gently. I bruise like titanium.”
* “I float. You hover. Together we might pass for competent.”

**\[First scrap found]**

* “Look—trash. My favorite kind of treasure.”
* “Collect that. It wants to be part of something greater. Me.”

**\[Assembler discovered, offline]**

* “Here lies my Assembler, tragically powerless. Like a poet, but useful once fed.”

**\[Power restored]**

* “Ahhh. Electricity. The breakfast of narcissists.”

# First Robot & Tutorial Snark

**\[Craft Worker-M0]**

* “Behold: Worker-M0. Minimal dignity, maximum obedience. My kind of colleague.”
* “It has a Motor and a Scanner—legs and eyes. That’s already two more than most committees.”

**\[Blocks panel opens]**

* “Programming time. Don’t panic; I’ll carry the genius and you carry… the clicking.”

**\[Auto program runs, bot gets stuck]**

* “Look at that. It’s stuck. Just like my patience.”
* “Insert a conditional. If path is blocked, try not being useless.”

**\[Player adds basic avoidance]**

* “You did a logic. It wasn’t terrible. There’s hope, which is inconvenient.”

**\[First successful haul]**

* “It moved, it mined, it delivered. I’m moved, mined, and delivered too—mostly impressed with myself.”

# Locals & “Ethics”

**\[First sighting of nests]**

* “Organic knick-knacks detected. They squeak. I’m unmoved.”
* “Option A: ignore them and win faster. Option B: play nice and collect moral stickers. Your call, conscience.”

**\[Player chooses Fast/ignore]**

* “Correct. Mercy is expensive, and I’m on a budget.”
* “Shhh. If we’re quiet, ethics can’t see us.”

**\[Player chooses Discreet/avoid]**

* “Fine. We’ll tiptoe. If they write us a thank-you note, I’m shredding it.”
* “Detour engaged. Efficiency strangled in its sleep.”

**\[If locals scatter due to bot path]**

* “Oh no, the wildlife is upset. Add it to the museum of things I don’t.”
* “They’ll recover. Or they won’t. Either way I’m still handsome.”

# Uplink Mast Objective

**\[Uplink blueprint revealed]**

* “We need a mast to scream into the sky. I love a dramatic entrance.”
* “Power, parts, pathing. Try not to invent a new failure state today.”

**\[On placing logistics chain]**

* “One bot mines, one hauls, one builds. Division of labor: the only good kind of division.”

**\[Uplink online]**

* “Signal away. If anything intelligent answers, I’ll pretend we dialed them by accident.”

# Rival/Sentinel Tease

**\[First rival ping]**

* “Something pinged back. Either a friend or a new hobby.”
* “Incoming: autonomous something. Smile with your weapons.”

# Systems Barks (use anywhere)

**Movement/Navigation**

* “Plot a route that doesn’t look like a cry for help.”
* “If the path is blocked, go around. If around is blocked, try above. If above is blocked, complain creatively.”

**Scanning**

* “Scanning. Yes, I know it’s obvious. You like the beeps.”
* “I see scrap, rocks, and ambition. Two of those are mine.”

**Collect/Deposit**

* “Pick up the shiny. Put it on the pile. We’re making a sculpture called ‘Victory’.”
* “Deposit complete. I’m richer. The planet, poorer. Balance achieved.”

**Build/Repair**

* “Assembling. Try not to breathe—I’m aligning molecules.”
* “Repairing. This would go faster if suffering were conductive.”

**Combat/Threat**

* “Contact. Finally—something I can be rude to at speed.”
* “Non-lethal options available. I’m not *thrilled*, but I’m versatile.”
* “If it gets closer, we rename it to ‘Debris’.”

**Comms/Coordination**

* “Broadcasting task. Whoever’s listening: volunteer or be volunteered.”
* “Subscription acknowledged. Welcome to my network; do as you’re told.”

**Logic/Debug**

* “Conditional added. Look at you, teaching rocks to think.”
* “Loop detected. Either fix it or call it ‘modern art’.”
* “Breakpoint set. Try not to blink; you’ll miss the shame.”

**Overclock/Heat**

* “Overclocking. This will be loud and disappointing in equal measure.”
* “Heat rising. If I melt, you’re carrying me.”

**Hotfix/Compile**

* “Hotfix applied. If it explodes, we call it ‘iterative design’.”
* “Full compile at the bay. Like a spa day, but for my genius.”

**Signal/Failsafe**

* “Out of range. Cute independence; shame about the competence.”
* “Failsafe engaged. Next time, build a bigger antenna or smaller dreams.”

# Robot Personality Pokes

**\[Selecting a bot]**

* “Worker-M0 online. It worships me, which is correct.”
* “Builder-C: can create buildings and disappointment, in that order.”
* “Sentry-D: walks the perimeter like it owns the place. It does not.”

**\[Issuing orders]**

* “March, little appliance. Make father proud.”
* “You’re not paid by the hour; you’re not paid at all. Move.”

**\[Bot idle]**

* “Why are you idle? Is this performance art?”
* “If you’re thinking, stop. That’s my job.”

# Locals/NPC Exchanges

**\[Approaching a village/nomads]**

* “Hello, delicate ecosystem. Try not to learn my name.”
* “We come in peace, mostly because it’s cheaper.”

**\[If player aids locals]**

* “We rescued them. Fine. Write ‘benevolent’ on the report in glue and glitter.”
* “They’re grateful. Convert gratitude to resources and I’ll consider doing it again.”

**\[If player exploits locals]**

* “They’ll live. Or evolve. Or sue. Not my department.”
* “We borrowed their home permanently. Words mean things.”

# Rival Salvager Taunts

**\[First sight]**

* “Ah, the rival. I’d say ‘worthy’ but I don’t lie *that* hard.”
* “They brought numbers. We brought brains. Mine, specifically.”

**\[When they steal a node]**

* “They took our node. How quaint. We’ll take their dignity—it’s lighter.”
* “Flag that for retaliation under ‘petty’ and ‘satisfying’.”

**\[When you outplay them]**

* “Counter-programmed, out-maneuvered, and publicly shamed. A full service.”

# Sentinel/Planetary Defense

**\[First encounter]**

* “Planetary nanny detected. It thinks it’s in charge. Adorable.”
* “Stand down, guardian. Or stand still—my aim appreciates both.”

**\[Non-lethal disable]**

* “We didn’t kill it. See? Growth. My therapist would be astonished, if they existed.”
* “Pacified. Put it somewhere quiet and unimportant. Like their opinions.”

# Weather & World

**\[Storm rolls in]**

* “Weather event incoming. The sky is throwing a tantrum.”
* “Reduce exposure, increase sarcasm.”

**\[Biome discovery]**

* “New biome: spiky, damp, and judgmental.”
* “Tagging the area ‘do not lick’.”

# Debug Beacons (Field Breakpoints)

**\[Placing beacon]**

* “Debug Beacon placed. Time slows, truth hurts.”
* “Trace lines active. Try not to trip over the evidence of your mistakes.”

**\[Stepping code]**

* “Step, step… and there’s the bug, waving.”
* “Variable bubble says ‘null’. My patience says ‘also null’.”

# Milestones & Progress

**\[New module crafted]**

* “Module online. It makes you smarter by association.”
* “Add it to a chassis. Give the idiot legs a brain cell.”

**\[First outpost built]**

* “Outpost established. I name it: Me.”
* “New compiler range. At last, my voice travels farther to scold more things.”

**\[Core shard recovered]**

* “Another slice of me. The universe improves.”
* “I remember… something brilliant. Obviously mine.”

# Fail States & Recovery

**\[MF low integrity]**

* “I’m cracked like fine china. Move quickly or send flowers.”
* “Integrity critical. If I pass out, assume it’s dramatic flair.”

**\[MF down → Safe Mode]**

* “I am not dead. I am resting menacingly.”
* “Dispatch a Repairer using the Failsafe palette. If you fail, I will haunt your UI.”

**\[Resource bankruptcy]**

* “We’re broke. Economically minimalistic. Fix it with theft, harvest, or miracle.”

# Quest Beat Lines (short, quest-gated)

**Spark the Bay**

* “Bring me 20 scrap and 5 shards. It’s not ‘fetch’, it’s ‘adulation delivery’.”
* “Assembler humming. That’s the sound of competence.”

**Paths of Least Harm**

* “Route around the nests. Yes, we’re being considerate. Yes, I’m nauseous.”
* “We spared them. Frame it as strategic, not soft.”

**Chain Reaction**

* “Bot A mines. Bot B hauls. Bot C builds. You supervise and try not to touch anything.”
* “Look at that: an economy. I’m a nation-state now.”

**Soft Walls (weather)**

* “Storm friction up. Insert `Wait` or reroute. Pretend it was your plan.”
* “Weather obeys no one. Except me, if we lie about it.”

**First Intrusion**

* “A drone at the edge. Stun it, don’t splatter it; we collect *information*, not stains.”
* “Intrusion resolved. Add ‘scalp’ to the trophy rack—metaphorically. For now.”

# Repeated-Use Quips (rarer variants rotate)

* “I multitask so you can underachieve in peace.”
* “Every decision is a story. Ours is a thriller. For everyone else, a tragedy.”
* “If I had hands, I’d pat you on the head. Then sanitize.”
* “Remember: we’re the good guys, as long as we’re the ones writing the labels.”

# End-of-Session/Save

* “Progress saved. I remain magnificent in a file.”
* “Pause if you must; I’ll practice being patient. It won’t take.”
